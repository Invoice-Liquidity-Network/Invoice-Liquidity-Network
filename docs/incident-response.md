# Main-Repo Incident Response Runbook

This document defines the operational incident response runbook for the **Invoice Liquidity Network (ILN) Core Repository**, which hosts the **TypeScript SDK**, **Indexer Service**, **Notifications Service**, and **Oracle Service**.

Because both the **Soroban Smart Contracts (`backend`)** and the **Web Application (`frontend`)** depend directly on these core services and libraries, an incident originating in this repository has a protocol-wide blast radius that neither dependent repository's runbook can fully contain on its own.

## 1. Cross-Repo Escalation & Ownership Matrix

Incidents in the main repository frequently intersect with contract execution and frontend user interfaces. The table below establishes clear component ownership and escalation paths across all three repositories:

| Incident Type | Primary Escalation Owner | Impacted Downstream Repos | Immediate Containment Action | Cross-Repo Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SDK Compromise** (malicious npm package, XDR mutation) | SDK Lead / Security Team | `frontend`, third-party integrators | Deprecate npm version, publish security advisory, enforce SLSA attestation verification | [Frontend Runbook](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Frontend/blob/main/docs/incident-response.md#step-2-emergency-vercel-rollback-sev-1-mitigation) |
| **Indexer Data Loss / Corruption** | Infrastructure Lead | `frontend`, analytics dashboards | Switch frontend to direct Soroban RPC read mode, restore SQLite WAL backup | [Frontend Runbook](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Frontend/blob/main/docs/incident-response.md#step-1-execute-feature-flag-kill-switches) |
| **Indexer Performance Degradation** (slow queries, stalled cursor) | Infrastructure Lead | `frontend` (stale data only) | Restart indexer service, investigate query plans, check index health | [Scenario C Details](#scenario-c-indexer-performance-degradation-slow-queries--ledger-cursor-stalled) |
| **Oracle-Service Compromise** | Security Lead & Governance Lead | `backend`, `frontend` | Disable oracle feature flag in frontend (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ORACLE_ENABLED=false`), trigger contract fallback mode | [Contract Policy](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Smart-Contract/blob/main/docs/security.md#oracle-integration--manipulation) |
| **Notifications Abuse** (SSRF, Webhook flood) | Backend Services Lead | Integrator webhooks, user channels | Rotate HMAC signing keys, enforce IP blocklist, trip service circuit breaker | [Security Policy](../SECURITY.md#severity-classification) |
| **Contract-Level Emergency** (drained escrow, reentrancy) | Smart Contract Lead | `backend`, `frontend` | Trigger contract pause via admin multisig | [Contract Reentrancy Matrix](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Smart-Contract/blob/main/docs/security.md#reentrancy-analysis-issue-535) |

### Emergency Notification Channels
- **Security Lead / Incident Commander**: `@sec-commander` / `security@invoiceliquidity.network`
- **Frontend Lead**: `@frontend-leads` (coordinates UI feature flags & Vercel rollbacks)
- **Contract Lead**: `@contract-leads` (coordinates Soroban contract pause/unpause)
- **Infrastructure Lead**: `@infra-leads` (manages indexer & notifications deployments)

---

## 2. Incident Severity Classification

| Level | Impact Description | Core Component Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SEV-1 (Critical)** | Active loss of funds, compromised SDK package on npm, corrupted ledger data leading to wrong payouts, or rogue Oracle responses. | - Malicious SDK package published to npm.<br>- Oracle service returning forged high trust scores for fraudulent payers.<br>- Database corruption causing false invoice status reporting across all users. |
| **SEV-2 (High)** | Degradation of core infrastructure services without direct loss of funds; notification service SSRF or unauthorized webhook relay. | - Indexer sync lag exceeding 100 ledgers.<br>- Webhook delivery SSRF vulnerability exploited to probe internal endpoints.<br>- Unhandled RPC rate-limiting blocking event ingestion. |
| **SEV-3 (Medium/Low)** | Non-critical service outage, isolated notification delivery failure, minor metrics API gap. | - SMS/Email provider quota exhaustion.<br>- Transient WebSocket connection drops.<br>- Indexer `/v1/stats` endpoint returning stale cache. |

---

## 3. Incident Scenarios & Response Procedures

### Scenario A: SDK Compromise or Supply-Chain Poisoning

#### 1. Blast Radius & Hop-by-Hop Trust Boundary
As documented in the [Protocol Threat Model](./threat-model.md#1-sdk-threat-surface) and [Security Guide](./security-guide.md#security-overview), the SDK sits between user input and wallet transaction signing:
`User Input → App UI → SDK Transaction Builder → Wallet Signing (Freighter) → Soroban RPC`.

A compromised SDK package (e.g. via stolen npm credentials or malicious transitive dependency) can inject forged XDR envelopes, alter target contract addresses, or substitute recipient keys prior to user signature.

#### 2. Containment & Remediation Workflow
1. **Unpublish / Deprecate Compromised NPM Releases**:
   ```bash
   # Deprecate the compromised package version immediately on npm registry
   npm deprecate @invoice-liquidity/sdk@<COMPROMISED_VERSION> "CRITICAL SECURITY ADVISORY: Do not use this version. Upgrade to patched release."
   ```
2. **Verify SLSA Level 3 Provenance Attestation**:
   Compare published artifact digests against GitHub Actions build attestations to confirm clean release hashes:
   ```bash
   gh attestation verify sdk-package.tgz --repo Invoice-Liquidity-Network/Invoice-Liquidity-Network
   ```
3. **Notify Downstream Consumers & Frontend Team**:
   - Instruct the **Frontend Team** to execute an emergency deployment pinning a verified safe SDK version ([Frontend Runbook Procedures](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Frontend/blob/main/docs/incident-response.md#step-2-emergency-vercel-rollback-sev-1-mitigation)).
   - Issue an advisory instructing third-party integrators to verify lockfile integrity (`pnpm-lock.yaml`) and check package signatures via `npm audit signatures @invoice-liquidity/sdk`.
4. **Publish Clean Patch Release**:
   Publish a patched version built exclusively via automated CI (`.github/workflows/sdk-release.yml`) with updated SLSA attestations.

---

### Scenario B: Indexer Data-Loss or State Corruption

#### 1. Blast Radius
The indexer parses Soroban event streams to populate the REST API (`/v1/invoice/:id`, `/v1/stats`) and frontend dashboards. An indexer database crash, storage corruption, or missed ledger window causes stale or inaccurate protocol state reporting to users.

#### 2. Restoration & Recovery Workflow
1. **Switch Downstream Frontend to Direct On-Chain Read Mode**:
   If indexer data is corrupted, instruct the Frontend Lead to set `NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_ENABLED=false` so the web app falls back to querying the Soroban RPC directly for authoritative state.
2. **Isolate & Stop Corrupted Indexer Service**:
   ```bash
   # Stop the running indexer process
   systemctl stop iln-indexer
   ```
3. **Restore SQLite WAL Backup**:
   Locate the latest verified SQLite snapshot (managed via `scripts/monitor.sh` and database backup routines):
   ```bash
   # Backup corrupted file for forensic investigation
   mv indexer.db indexer_corrupted_$(date +%s).sqlite

   # Restore latest clean snapshot
   cp /var/backups/iln/indexer_last_good.sqlite indexer.db
   ```
4. **Reconcile Ledger Cursor & Resync**:
   Inspect the last synced ledger marker in the restored database and restart the indexer with resynchronization enabled:
   ```bash
   # Verify database integrity
   sqlite3 indexer.db "PRAGMA quick_check;"

   # Restart service to resume catch-up sync from Horizon / Soroban RPC
   systemctl start iln-indexer
   ```
5. **Verify Indexer Data Integrity**:
   Run the synthetic canary check to ensure indexer REST endpoints return valid status:
   ```bash
   pnpm exec tsx scripts/synthetic-canary.ts
   ```

#### 3. Alert Reference

The data-integrity alerts in `monitoring/prometheus/data-loss-alerts.yml` carry a `runbook_url` pointing at the matching heading below. `scripts/check-alert-runbook-links.mjs` fails CI if a new alert is added without one.

#### ILNIndexerLedgerSequenceGapDetected
- **Trigger**: the indexer's last processed ledger is more than 50 behind the Soroban RPC tip for 2m.
- **Triage**: compare `indexer_last_processed_ledger` with the RPC's latest ledger; check poller logs for RPC 429s, timeouts, or a crash loop. A gap that is still growing means events are not being ingested at all.
- **Action**: restart the poller if it is wedged; once it catches up, run the Restoration workflow above (step 5) to confirm no invoice state was skipped. Escalate to the Indexer Lead if the gap persists after a restart.

#### ILNStateSnapshotMismatchDetected
- **Trigger**: any on-chain state root hash that differs from the indexed database state (`iln_state_snapshot_hash_mismatch_total`). Still waiting on instrumentation; see `monitoring/alert-audit/incidents.json`.
- **Triage**: identify the ledger range of the mismatch from the indexer logs and check for a reorg (`ILNIndexerLedgerSequenceGapDetected` firing around the same time points at a lag rather than corruption).
- **Action**: treat as SEV-1 data corruption; stop downstream consumers (oracle verdicts, notifications) and restore from the last good backup per the Restoration workflow above.

#### ILNOraclePayloadDataCorruption
- **Trigger**: any malformed oracle payload or payload signature mismatch (`iln_oracle_payload_corrupt_counter`). Still waiting on instrumentation; see `monitoring/alert-audit/incidents.json`.
- **Triage**: check whether one source or every source is producing corrupt payloads; one source points at an upstream outage, every source at a schema change or a compromised signing key.
- **Action**: demote the corrupt source (Scenario D, Containment step 1); rotate the signing key if signatures fail on every source.

#### ILNUnindexedContractEventDropRate
- **Trigger**: emitted contract events outpace persisted indexer events by more than 0.05/s for 3m.
- **Triage**: check `iln_db_errors_total` and SQLite lock status; dead-letter rows (`indexer/src/deadLetter.ts`) show whether events were malformed rather than dropped.
- **Action**: clear the write backlog (disk space, `SQLITE_BUSY`), then replay the affected ledger range so every emitted event is persisted.

---

### Scenario C: Indexer Performance Degradation (Slow Queries / Ledger Cursor Stalled)

#### 1. Blast Radius

The indexer's polling loop fetches new ledger events every N milliseconds. If database queries become slow (> 5 seconds), the polling loop blocks and fails to advance the ledger cursor. The frontend receives stale state via `/v1/stats`, but on-chain state remains authoritative and unaffected.

**Key Distinction:** This is NOT data loss or corruption (Scenario B); the database is healthy but queries are slow. Frontline symptoms mimic data corruption but remediation is different.

#### 2. Detection & Diagnosis Workflow

1. **Check Indexer Health Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl http://indexer:3001/health
   # Should return: { "status": "ok", "db": "ok", "lastLedger": <N> }
   ```

2. **Check Cursor Advancement**:
   ```bash
   curl http://indexer:3001/metrics | grep 'iln_last_processed_ledger'
   # If flat-lining (not advancing for > 2 minutes), proceed to step 3
   ```

3. **Query Database Directly for Slow Query Indicators**:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 indexer.db "PRAGMA query_only=true; .timer on"
   sqlite3 indexer.db "SELECT last_ledger FROM cursor WHERE id = 1;"
   # If this takes > 5 seconds, the query plan is degraded
   ```

4. **Check for Index Corruption**:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 indexer.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
   # Should return: "ok"
   ```

#### 3. Containment & Recovery

**DO NOT escalate to the smart-contract team** unless `PRAGMA integrity_check` fails (which would indicate Scenario B).

1. **Quick Fix: Restart Indexer Service**:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart iln-indexer
   # Monitor cursor advancement for 2 minutes
   watch -n 1 'curl -s http://indexer:3001/metrics | grep iln_last_processed_ledger'
   # Should advance every 5–10 seconds after restart
   ```

2. **If Restart Doesn't Fix It: Investigate Query Plans**:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 indexer.db "EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT last_ledger FROM cursor WHERE id = 1;"
   # Output should show: "SEARCH cursor USING sqlite_autoindex_cursor_1 (id=?)"
   # If it shows "SCAN TABLE cursor", indexes are missing or corrupted
   ```

3. **If Indexes Are Missing: Rebuild Indexes from Schema**:
   The indexer schema includes indexes in `indexer/src/db.ts`. If indexes are missing, manually re-apply the schema:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 indexer.db < indexer/src/db.ts
   systemctl restart iln-indexer
   ```

4. **If Query Plans Are Still Degraded: Check for Query Regressions**:
   A recent deployment may have introduced a new query that lacks indexes. Compare recent commits to `indexer/src/db.ts` and `indexer/src/processor.ts` against the last known-good deployment.

#### 4. Escalation Decision Tree

- ✅ **Restart Fixed It:** No cross-repo escalation. Log the incident and investigate why restart was needed (memory leak? connection exhaustion?).
- ⚠️ **Restart Didn't Fix It + PRAGMA integrity_check Failed:** Escalate to **Scenario B (Data Loss / Corruption)** immediately.
- ⚠️ **Restart Didn't Fix It + Integrity OK:** Notify Infrastructure Lead and Smart Contract Lead that performance may degrade user experience, but no funds are at risk. Frontend can switch to direct RPC reads if desired.

#### 5. Prevention

Deploy the following Prometheus alerting rules (located in `monitoring/prometheus/indexer-alerts.yml`):

```yaml
- alert: IndexerSlowQuery
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(iln_db_query_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 5
  for: 2m
  annotations:
    summary: "Indexer queries slower than 5s (p95)"
    description: "95th percentile query duration exceeds 5 seconds. Check PRAGMA integrity_check and query plans."

- alert: IndexerCursorStalled
  expr: increase(iln_last_processed_ledger[2m]) == 0
  for: 1m
  annotations:
    summary: "Indexer cursor has not advanced in 2 minutes"
    description: "Ledger sync is stuck. Check slow queries, RPC connectivity, and service logs."
```

#### 6. Alert Reference

Every indexer alert in `monitoring/prometheus/availability-alerts.yml` and `monitoring/prometheus/slo-alerts.yml` carries a `runbook_url` pointing at the matching heading below. `scripts/check-alert-runbook-links.mjs` fails CI if a new alert is added without one.

#### ServiceDown
- **Trigger**: a Prometheus scrape target (`iln-*` or `oracle-service`) has not answered for 2m. The ratio-based SLO alerts cannot see this state.
- **Triage**: check the process, its port and the network path from Prometheus; then the per-service triage in `docs/monitoring.md` section 8.
- **Action**: restart the service if it crashed; if it is up but unreachable, fix the scrape path before anything else, since every other alert for that service is blind until the scrape recovers.

#### IndexerCursorStale
- **Trigger**: the indexer is up but `iln_cursor_updated_at` is more than 60s old for 5m (Signal 2 warning).
- **Triage**: inspect the poller logs for RPC rate limiting (429) or timeouts and check SQLite lock status.
- **Action**: follow the Detection & Diagnosis workflow above; if the RPC provider is throttling, fail over to the secondary RPC endpoint.

#### IndexerCursorStaleCritical
- **Trigger**: cursor lag above 300s for 5m (Signal 2 critical). Oracle verdicts and notifications are now serving stale state.
- **Triage**: as for `IndexerCursorStale`; confirm the poller process is alive and whether it is looping on a single ledger.
- **Action**: restart the poller or replay from the last cursor checkpoint (Containment & Recovery above); page the Indexer Lead.

#### IndexerDatabaseErrors
- **Trigger**: any increase in `iln_db_errors_total` over 10m. The health endpoint reports `db: error` for the same condition.
- **Triage**: check disk space on the SQLite volume and `SQLITE_BUSY` in the logs; a burst that coincides with an export job points at lock contention rather than corruption.
- **Action**: free disk or reduce concurrent writers; if errors continue with free disk, run an integrity check and restore from backup per Scenario B.

#### IndexerAvailabilityFastBurn
- **Trigger**: 14x burn rate on the 99.9% availability SLO over both 5m and 1h, which spends 2% of the monthly error budget per hour.
- **Triage**: check `iln_http_errors_total` by route, Stellar RPC health, and DB lock status.
- **Action**: treat as an outage; roll back the last indexer deploy if the burn started with it, otherwise follow Containment & Recovery above.

#### IndexerAvailabilitySlowBurn
- **Trigger**: 6x burn rate sustained over 30m and 6h; at this rate the monthly budget runs out in about five days.
- **Triage**: usually a slow regression rather than an outage; compare error rates before and after recent deploys and check p95 latency.
- **Action**: open an incident at SEV-3, bisect recent deploys, and fix forward within the budget window.

#### IndexerLatencyFastBurn
- **Trigger**: p95 read latency above 200ms over both 5m and 1h.
- **Triage**: check `iln_db_query_duration_seconds` and RPC latency; the slow-query log identifies the query.
- **Action**: follow the Detection & Diagnosis workflow above (missing index, lock contention, RPC provider).

#### IndexerLatencySlowBurn
- **Trigger**: p95 read latency above 200ms sustained over 30m and 6h.
- **Triage**: check the DB query latency and event loop lag panels in the unified dashboard for a gradual drift (growing table without an index, cache hit rate decay).
- **Action**: add or rebuild the index for the slow query; schedule a VACUUM if the database file has grown past the documented threshold.

---

### Scenario D: Oracle-Service Compromise or Malfunction

#### 1. Blast Radius
The `oracle-service` assesses payer addresses and returns credit scores and verification markers (`/v1/verify`). A compromised or malfunctioning oracle service could return inflated trust scores for fraudulent payers or fail during invoice funding checks.

#### 2. Containment & Remediation Workflow
1. **Trigger Frontend Oracle Kill-Switch**:
   Instruct the Frontend Team to immediately disable live oracle verification via feature flag:
   ```bash
   # Disable oracle checks in frontend deployment
   vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_ORACLE_ENABLED production false
   vercel --prod
   ```
   *(See [Frontend Incident Response Runbook](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Frontend/blob/main/docs/incident-response.md#step-1-execute-feature-flag-kill-switches)).*
2. **Purge Poisoned Oracle Cache**:
   If the oracle service cache contains manipulated payer reputation records, purge the internal cache:
   ```bash
   # Send cache purge command to oracle service API
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3010/v1/admin/purge-cache \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ORACLE_ADMIN_SECRET}"
   ```
3. **Audit Smart Contract Fallback Mode**:
   Confirm that the Soroban contract's static bounds fallback is active. Per [backend/docs/security.md#oracle-integration--manipulation](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Smart-Contract/blob/main/docs/security.md#oracle-integration--manipulation), smart contracts do not depend solely on off-chain oracle prices for accounting and enforce safety limits natively.
4. **Rotate Oracle Signing Keys & Update On-Chain Registry**:
   If oracle private key compromise is suspected:
   - Rotate oracle keypair in secret manager.
   - Submit a governance proposal or admin multisig transaction to update the oracle registry on-chain ([ADR-010 Oracle Registry](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Smart-Contract/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-010-oracle-registry.md)).

#### 3. Alert Reference

Every `oracle-service` paging alert (`monitoring/prometheus/oracle-service-alerts.yml`) carries a `runbook_url` annotation pointing at the matching heading below. `scripts/check-alert-runbook-links.mjs` fails CI if a new alert is added without one.

#### OracleFraudFlagRateHigh
- **Trigger**: >25% of oracle verdicts fraud-flagged over 10m.
- **Triage**: query `oracle_fraud_signal_total` broken out by heuristic — a single dominant signal indicates a heuristic bug, a spread across signals indicates a coordinated probe.
- **Action**: if a heuristic bug, roll back the last oracle-service deploy; if an attack, escalate to the Security Lead and consider tightening the fraud-flag threshold per Containment step 1 above.

#### OracleFraudFlagRateCritical
- **Trigger**: >60% of verdicts fraud-flagged over 5m — legitimate funding is almost certainly being blocked.
- **Action**: treat as SEV-1 heuristic regression until proven otherwise; page the Security Lead immediately, roll back the last heuristic change, and re-check the fraud-flag rate post-rollback.

#### OracleNoVerifications
- **Trigger**: zero verification requests for 15m while the service reports healthy.
- **Triage**: confirm whether upstream traffic to `/v1/verify` has actually stopped (indexer/frontend metrics), or requests are erroring before reaching the verifier (check ingress/load-balancer 5xx).
- **Action**: if requests are being dropped pre-verifier, check for a crash loop or an exhausted connection pool; restart the service if a leak is confirmed.

#### OracleAllVerificationsRejected
- **Trigger**: >95% rejection rate over 10m — `fund_invoice()`'s require_oracle_verification path is effectively closed.
- **Triage**: inspect the outcome breakdown — `rejected-stale-data` points at a broken indexer feed (Scenario B), `rejected-low-trust` at a reputation-lookup failure.
- **Action**: treat as SEV-1; follow Containment steps 1–3 above (kill-switch, cache purge, contract fallback audit).

#### OracleCacheHitRateLow
- **Trigger**: cache hit rate <20% for 15m.
- **Triage**: expected briefly after a deploy or Redis restart; sustained low hit rate means the cache backend is unreachable and every request recomputes.
- **Action**: check Redis connectivity and restart the cache connection or fail over; expect `OracleVerificationLatencyHigh` to follow if left unresolved.

#### OracleExternalProviderUnavailable
- **Trigger**: >50% of external KYB lookups return `unknown` over 10m.
- **Triage**: the provider is likely down; verdicts still resolve (unknown is treated as inert), so this degrades confidence rather than causing an outage.
- **Action**: check the provider's status page; note reduced verdict confidence in the incident log if this coincides with a funding dispute.

#### OracleDeltaHoldsNotDraining
- **Trigger**: delta-bound updates have been held for review for more than 10m (`oracle_delta_holds_active > 0`). Funding still works on the last known-good verdict.
- **Triage**: list the held updates at `GET /v1/oracle/delta-holds`; sustained holds usually mean the bound is too tight for a legitimately volatile payer, or an upstream source is stuck.
- **Action**: resolve each hold (accept publishes the proposed score, reject restores the previous one); see `docs/oracle-source-failover-runbook.md`.

#### OracleDeltaBoundViolationsElevated
- **Trigger**: more than 0.05 bound violations per second per feed for 15m. Occasional holds are the guard working; a sustained rate means many subjects are moving past the bound at once.
- **Triage**: a single feed points at a corrupted upstream; every feed at once points at a deliberate attempt to swing scores.
- **Action**: demote the suspect source (Containment step 1 above); if it is an attack, escalate to the Security Lead and keep the holds unresolved until the feed is verified.

#### OracleDeltaQuorumConfirmationsHigh
- **Trigger**: independent sources are corroborating movements that breach the single-source bound (more than 0.05/s for 30m), so they publish without a hold.
- **Triage**: expected during real reputation shifts; if it coincides with `OracleDeltaBoundViolationsElevated`, the widening is genuine.
- **Action**: informational; record the shift in the incident log if a funding dispute follows.

#### OracleSourceUnavailable
- **Trigger**: the source health tracker has demoted a source out of rotation (`oracle_source_health_state >= 2`) for 5m.
- **Triage**: if a fallback is configured, traffic has already moved and verdicts still resolve, but there is no second opinion until the source recovers. Check the upstream's status page and the error samples in the oracle logs.
- **Action**: follow `docs/oracle-source-failover-runbook.md`; if no fallback exists, treat as SEV-1 since `fund_invoice()` verification is blocked.

#### OracleSourceDegraded
- **Trigger**: a source is above its error-rate or p95-latency threshold but still serving (`oracle_source_health_state == 1`) for 15m.
- **Triage**: early warning rather than an incident; look at latency and error trends on the upstream before it escalates to `OracleSourceUnavailable`.
- **Action**: raise with the provider; pre-warm the fallback source so a demotion does not cold-start it.

#### OracleFailoverChurn
- **Trigger**: more than three failover events in 30m, which beats the anti-flap recovery streak and cooldown.
- **Triage**: a source is oscillating hard, or two sources are failing at once; compare the health state of every source over the window.
- **Action**: pin routing to the healthier source until the flapping one is stable; widen the cooldown if the oscillation is a provider pattern rather than an outage.

#### OracleFreshnessFastBurn
- **Trigger**: 6x burn rate on the 99.5% freshness SLO over both 5m and 1h.
- **Triage**: check indexer lag (`iln_cursor_updated_at`) and reputation-contract reachability; the Indexer Lag vs Oracle Stale Responses correlation panel shows which one moved first.
- **Action**: if the indexer has fallen behind, follow Scenario C; if the reputation contract is unreachable, check Soroban RPC health and fail over the RPC endpoint.

#### OracleFreshnessSlowBurn
- **Trigger**: 3x burn rate on the freshness SLO sustained over 30m and 6h.
- **Triage**: compare `ORACLE_MAX_ORACLE_AGE_MS` with the observed indexer sync lag; a slow drift usually follows a change to either.
- **Action**: restore indexer sync health or correct the freshness threshold; do not widen the threshold to silence the alert without an incident note.

#### OracleLatencyFastBurn
- **Trigger**: p95 verification latency above 1s over both 5m and 1h, so callers time out before the oracle does.
- **Triage**: check indexer response time and Soroban RPC latency; cross-reference `OracleCacheHitRateLow`.
- **Action**: if RPC-bound, fail over the provider; if cache-bound, restore the cache backend.

#### OracleLatencySlowBurn
- **Trigger**: p95 verification latency above 1s sustained over 30m and 6h.
- **Triage**: check cache hit rate and external provider latency for a gradual drift.
- **Action**: restore cache capacity or raise with the external provider; roll back any recent heuristic change that added upstream calls.

---

### Scenario E: Notifications Service Abuse (SSRF / Webhook Spam)

#### 1. Blast Radius
The notifications service processes user subscriptions and dispatches webhooks, emails, and SMS alerts upon invoice state changes. Attackers may attempt Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via malicious webhook URLs (`/subscribe`), send webhook spam, or exhaust SMS/email budgets.

#### 2. Containment & Remediation Workflow
1. **Activate Circuit Breaker & Clamping**:
   If webhook delivery targets are attacking internal endpoints or failing repeatedly:
   ```bash
   # Trigger emergency webhook pause via service admin endpoint
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4001/admin/circuit-breaker/trip \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${NOTIFICATIONS_ADMIN_SECRET}"
   ```
2. **Rotate Webhook HMAC Signing Secret**:
   If webhook secret leakage is suspected, rotate the secret to invalidate unverified dispatches:
   ```bash
   # Update WEBHOOK_HMAC_SECRET in production environment
   export WEBHOOK_HMAC_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
   systemctl restart iln-notifications
   ```
3. **Apply Domain Blocklist for SSRF Mitigation**:
   Update `BLOCKED_DOMAINS` to reject private IP ranges (`10.0.0.0/8`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.1`, `metadata.google.internal`):
   ```env
   DISALLOWED_WEBHOOK_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,169.254.169.254,0.0.0.0,::1
   ```
4. **Flush Poisoned Job Queue**:
   Purge pending outbound notification jobs from the queue if spam amplification is detected.

#### 3. Alert Reference

Every notifications alert in `monitoring/prometheus/availability-alerts.yml` and `monitoring/prometheus/slo-alerts.yml` carries a `runbook_url` pointing at the matching heading below. `scripts/check-alert-runbook-links.mjs` fails CI if a new alert is added without one.

#### NotificationsFallbackActive
- **Trigger**: fallback deliveries have been flowing for 15m, so a primary provider is failing health checks. Deliveries still succeed and the delivery SLO stays green.
- **Triage**: check `/health/providers` and the provider dashboards (Resend, Twilio) for the failing primary.
- **Action**: fix or replace the primary provider credentials; keep an eye on fallback capacity, since `NotificationLatencyFastBurn` follows when it saturates.

#### NotificationDeliveryFastBurn
- **Trigger**: 14x burn rate on the 99.9% delivery SLO over both 5m and 1h.
- **Triage**: check `iln_notifications_failures_total` by channel and reason, provider health at `/health/providers`, and the audit log at `/audit/deliveries`; the fallback deliveries panel shows whether degraded-mode routing is active.
- **Action**: if one channel is failing, disable it and let the others continue; if webhooks are failing on SSRF rejections, follow the Containment workflow above.

#### NotificationDeliverySlowBurn
- **Trigger**: 6x burn rate sustained over 30m and 6h.
- **Triage**: check webhook SSRF rejections and Resend/Twilio provider health for a slow degradation.
- **Action**: rotate or repair the degraded provider; review recently added webhook subscriptions for hosts that are being rejected.

#### NotificationLatencyFastBurn
- **Trigger**: p95 delivery latency above 5s over both 5m and 1h for 10m.
- **Triage**: check rate-limit rejections and fallback capacity; a saturated fallback provider queues deliveries.
- **Action**: raise the fallback provider's capacity or restore the primary; shed digest batches if the queue keeps growing.

#### NotificationLatencySlowBurn
- **Trigger**: p95 delivery latency above 5s sustained over 30m and 6h.
- **Triage**: the Oracle Latency vs Notification Volume correlation panel in the unified dashboard shows whether a cross-service cause (oracle verdict volume) is driving it.
- **Action**: fix the upstream cause if cross-service; otherwise tune delivery concurrency or provider timeouts.

---

### Scenario F: Simultaneous Multi-Service Outage (Indexer + Oracle Service) (#1105)

#### 1. Blast Radius
A simultaneous failure of both the **Indexer Service** and **Oracle Service** creates severe protocol-wide degradation:
- Read queries (`/v1/invoice`, dashboards) fail or return stale cache.
- Oracle gating (`fund_invoice()` path with `require_oracle_verification: true`) blocks new funding operations.

#### 2. Emergency Containment & Feature Flag Priority
As validated during the multi-service outage game-day (`docs/game-days/2026-09-multi-service-outage-game-day.md`), execute containment in exact priority order:

1. **Step 1: Switch Frontend Read Path to Direct Soroban RPC**:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_ENABLED=false
   ```
   *Impact*: Bypasses indexer; queries RPC node directly for authoritative invoice state.

2. **Step 2: Bypass Oracle Gating in Frontend**:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ORACLE_ENABLED=false
   ```
   *Impact*: Enables standard invoice funding while oracle service is restored.

3. **Step 3: Recover Indexer & Oracle Services**:
   - Restore Indexer SQLite snapshot & resync from ledger head.
   - Restart Oracle service with warm cache.
   - Un-toggle feature flags once health checks pass (`200 OK`).

## 4. Post-Incident Review & Cross-Repo Sync

Following containment of any SEV-1 or SEV-2 incident:

1. **Post-Mortem Timeline**: Conduct a joint post-mortem within 72 hours involving representatives from `main`, `backend`, and `frontend` teams.
2. **Cross-Repo Verification**:
   - Run synthetic canary checks: `pnpm exec tsx scripts/synthetic-canary.ts`.
   - Run end-to-end integration tests across contract, SDK, and frontend packages.
3. **Public Advisory & Attribution**: Publish a coordinated GitHub Security Advisory per our root [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) guidelines and credit reporting researchers in `HALL_OF_FAME.md`.
