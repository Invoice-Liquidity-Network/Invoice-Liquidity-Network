# Oracle Service

Off-chain payer verification for `fund_invoice()`'s `require_oracle_verification`
path. Two independent signals feed one verdict, and the service is held to a
higher coverage bar than the rest of the monorepo because a bug here releases
funds against an invoice that should have been rejected.

## Signal composition

Two signals, answering different questions:

| Signal | Question | Time horizon |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fraud heuristic | Is this payer's *recent on-chain behaviour* consistent with a legitimate invoice? | Rolling 24h / 30d windows |
| External provider (KYB) | Is this legal entity *who they claim to be*? | Months |

### The policy

**Fraud signals are blocking, and a KYB pass cannot clear them.** A verified
business can still be compromised, coerced, or committing fraud; an identity
attestation says nothing about whether the current burst of near-identical
invoices is real. If KYB could override a fraud flag, the attestation would
become the single most valuable thing to obtain before an attack.

**A missing or negative KYB result is not blocking.** The protocol funds
pseudonymous on-chain payers by design, and most legitimate payers will never
appear in a KYB database. The external signal moves *confidence*, not the
verdict:

| External status | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `verified` | Confidence bonus (+0.15, scaled by the provider's own confidence) |
| `unverified` | Confidence capped at 0.6 |
| `unknown` | No adjustment at all |

`unknown` is deliberately distinct from `unverified`. A provider that is not
configured, times out, or has no record tells us nothing, and "we could not
check" must never be read as "we checked and they failed" — otherwise a provider
outage silently degrades every verdict in the system.

Confidence still has to clear the same 0.55 threshold, so a capped confidence
*can* flip a marginal verdict to rejected. That is the mechanism by which a weak
external signal tightens the bar without being an outright veto.

### Precedence

1. Stale source data → `rejected-stale-data`
2. Any fraud signal → `rejected-fraud-signals` (KYB cannot clear)
3. Trust or confidence below threshold → `rejected-low-trust`
4. Otherwise → `verified-both` or `verified-heuristic-only`

Staleness outranks fraud only because a stale assessment is not evidence of
anything — reporting a fraud verdict we cannot stand behind would be worse than
declining to answer.

### The response

Every verification carries a `composition` object with both sub-scores, not just
the final boolean, so `OracleBadge` can render the four cases distinctly:

```jsonc
{
  "isVerified": false,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "composition": {
    "policy": "heuristic-blocking-v1",
    "outcome": "rejected-fraud-signals",
    "rationale": "Fraud heuristics fired. External KYB verification does not clear behavioural fraud signals.",
    "heuristic": { "trustScore": 85, "confidence": 0.8, "confidenceLevel": "high", "fraudSignals": ["..."], "passed": false },
    "external":  { "status": "verified", "provider": "acme-kyb", "providerConfidence": null, "checkedAt": null, "reasons": [] },
    "baseConfidence": 0.8,
    "composedConfidence": 0.8
  }
}
```

`policy` is versioned so stored verdicts stay auditable when the rules change.

### Wiring a provider

`ExternalVerificationProvider` is a plain port — no provider is bundled:

```ts
const { app } = await createOracleApp({
  externalProvider: async (payer) => ({
    status: (await lookupKyb(payer)) ? 'verified' : 'unverified',
    provider: 'acme-kyb',
    providerConfidence: 0.9,
  }),
});
```

A provider that throws is reported as `unknown`, never `unverified`.

## Cache staleness

Verification results are cached, keyed on `payer:amount:invoiceId`. Fraud
heuristics are time-sensitive by construction — rapid-succession and
similar-amount detection both look at rolling windows — so a clean verdict is
only true as of the instant it was computed. Cached for the full 300 s, it
becomes a window in which a payer who has *just* started behaving fraudulently
still reads as clean.

Two mitigations, both in `cache.ts`:

**Asymmetric TTL.** A stale *clean* verdict is a security failure: bad actors
read as good. A stale *flagged* verdict is not: good actors read as bad, which
costs a re-check and fails safe. So clean verdicts for payers with activity
inside the rapid-succession window get 30 s; everything else keeps 300 s. Keeping
the full TTL on flagged verdicts also stops an attacker re-querying to grind out
a clean result.

**Explicit invalidation.** `POST /v1/cache/invalidate { payer }` drops every
cached verdict for a payer. The indexer calls this when it observes new activity,
so a clean verdict cannot outlive the behaviour it was computed from. Redis uses
`SCAN`, not `KEYS`, so invalidation never blocks the Redis event loop.

Callers can also pass `forceRefresh: true` to bypass the cache for a single
request.

## Verdict attestation

Every `POST /v1/verify` response can carry an `attestation`, so a consumer can
attribute a verdict to this oracle without trusting the transport it arrived on:

```typescript
{
  attestation: {
    keyId: string;      // which key signed it
    nonce: string;      // UUID, unique per publication
    issuedAt: number;   // seconds since the epoch
    payload: string;    // the verdict body, JSON, exactly as returned
    signature: string;  // HMAC-SHA256 over "keyId:nonce:issuedAt:payload"
  }
}
```

`payload` is the verdict serialised by the oracle itself, minus the `attestation`
field. Verify those bytes: re-marshalling the response object in another language
will not reproduce them, and the signature will not match.

Keys come from `ORACLE_SIGNING_KEY` (required in production — the service refuses
to boot without it, because an unattributable verdict is the exact risk the
caller is paying the oracle to remove). `ORACLE_SIGNING_KEY_ID` labels the active
key. During a rotation both keys are honoured for
`ORACLE_SIGNING_KEY_ROTATION_WINDOW_MS`, and
`GET /v1/signing/config` publishes the rotation state — `currentKeyId`,
`previousKeyId`, `rotationWindowOpen`, `rotationExpiresAt` — so verifiers can be
configured from the document rather than told out of band. The endpoint returns
503 while signing is unconfigured.

Replay is rejected: `verifySignedUpdate()` keeps every nonce it has accepted for
at least as long as the update stays fresh, and refuses an update whose `issuedAt`
has aged out even if the nonce has been forgotten. A verdict served from cache is
re-attested per request, so a consumer's replay cache counts publications, not
verdicts.

## Audit trail

Every published verdict is appended to a hash-chained, HMAC-signed trail before
the response leaves the process. An append failure fails the request: a verdict
that is served but not recorded is the forensic gap the trail exists to close.

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /v1/audit/entries` | Paged read: `from`, `to`, `payer`, `invoiceId`, `limit` (max 1000), `offset`. `total` counts the rows matching the filters, not the whole trail. |
| `GET /v1/audit/integrity` | Re-derives the chain and every entry's HMAC; 200 when valid, 500 plus the first offending sequence number when not. |

Both are read-only operator surfaces and should sit behind the same boundary as
`/metrics`. A store fault answers 500 rather than hanging.

Integrity reports which class of edit was found, not just that something is
wrong: `brokenAt` (content or hash changed), `badSignatureAt` (content rewritten
and re-hashed), `gapAt` (a row deleted), `columnMismatchAt` (an indexed column
rewritten so a payer disappears from a range query while the payload chain still
verifies), `anchorInvalid` (history truncated above a purge that cannot be
proved).

Tampering is modelled honestly: the threat is write access to the database, not
to the process. Someone who can rewrite rows can also recompute the chain with
the key the service holds, so the chain proves accidental corruption and
deletion, and the HMAC key's secrecy is what makes deliberate forgery by a
database-only attacker detectable. `AuditTrail.verifyWithKey()` exists for
out-of-band verification of a copy of the database with a key the running
service does not have.

Retention is a privacy obligation, not a cleanup convenience: `docs/privacy.md`
§4 caps these logs at one year. The window is enforced at boot and then hourly,
and a purge writes a signed anchor for what it removed so the surviving chain can
still be verified from the middle. The driver is SQLite
(`ORACLE_AUDIT_DB_PATH`), matching the indexer and notifications services; the
in-memory driver is refused outright in production, since a trail that loses its
contents on restart cannot honour the retention window it advertises.

## Monitoring

`/metrics` and `/v1/metrics` expose Prometheus text exposition.

| Metric | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oracle_verification_requests_total` | counter | Request volume |
| `oracle_verification_duration_seconds` | histogram | Latency |
| `oracle_cache_hits_total` / `_misses_total` | counter | Cache effectiveness |
| `oracle_stale_responses_total` | counter | Upstream data freshness |
| `oracle_verification_outcome_total` | counter | Verdicts by outcome, external status, cache hit |
| `oracle_fraud_signal_total` | counter | Individual heuristics as they fire |
| `oracle_fraud_flag_ratio` | gauge | Share of the last 200 verdicts carrying a fraud signal |
| `oracle_external_verification_total` | counter | Provider lookups by status |
| `oracle_audit_integrity_failures_total` | counter | Integrity checks that found a broken chain |

`oracle_audit_integrity_failures_total` only moves when something calls
`GET /v1/audit/integrity`, so there is deliberately no alert rule watching it: a
rule over a counter nobody increments looks protective and stays silent. Run the
check as a scheduled job, or scrape it after an incident, rather than assuming it
is continuous.

`oracle_fraud_flag_ratio` exists because the alert that matters — a sudden spike
in fraud-flagged submissions — is a question about the *share* of verdicts, not
the count. Cache hits are excluded from the ratio: they are replays of an earlier
verdict, and counting them would let one flagged payer retrying in a loop page
someone for a single actor.

### Setup

- Scrape config: `monitoring/prometheus/scrape-oracle-service.yml`. The job label
  must stay `oracle-service` — the `OracleNoVerifications` rule joins against
  `up{job="oracle-service"}`.
- Alert rules: `monitoring/prometheus/oracle-service-alerts.yml`.
- Uptime: `.upptimerc.yml` checks `/v1/health`, which reports `degraded` after a
  verification failure. A root check would keep returning 200 through exactly the
  failure worth knowing about.

### Alerts

| Alert | Condition | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OracleFraudFlagRateHigh` | 10m avg fraud-flag ratio > 25% | warning |
| `OracleFraudFlagRateCritical` | 5m avg > 60% | critical |
| `OracleNoVerifications` | no verifications for 15m while up | warning |
| `OracleAllVerificationsRejected` | >95% rejected over 10m | critical |
| `OracleStaleResponsesRising` | any stale response in 10m | warning |
| `OracleVerificationLatencyHigh` | p95 > 2s for 10m | warning |
| `OracleCacheHitRateLow` | hit rate < 20% for 15m | warning |
| `OracleExternalProviderUnavailable` | >50% `unknown` for 10m | warning |

A fraud-rate spike is either an attack or a heuristic regression. Check
`oracle_fraud_signal_total` to tell them apart: a single signal dominating points
at a bug, a spread across signals points at an attack.

`OracleNoVerifications` covers the failure a plain uptime check misses — the
service answering `/health` with 200 while verifying nothing.

## Testing

```bash
cd oracle-service
pnpm install --ignore-workspace
pnpm test              # unit tests
pnpm test:chaos        # upstream-outage suite only
pnpm test:coverage     # enforces the 95% gate
```

The 95% threshold lives in `oracle-service/vitest.config.ts`, so local runs
enforce the same bar as CI (`.github/workflows/coverage.yml`,
`oracle-service-coverage` job). `testFixtures.ts` and `chaosUpstream.ts` are
excluded from coverage — they are scaffolding, and counting them would inflate
the figure the gate exists to protect.

`--ignore-workspace` installs this package on its own. It is also a workspace
member (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`), so a root `pnpm install` covers it too; earlier
revisions of this document claimed otherwise.
# Oracle & Verification Infrastructure

## Overview

The Invoice Liquidity Network's oracle service provides off-chain verification of payer identity and payment history, enabling trustworthy on-chain invoice funding decisions without requiring full KYB (Know Your Business) integration.

This document describes the architecture, trust model, and operational resilience of the oracle service as it stands today—honestly scoped to reflect current capabilities and limitations, not as a polished future state.

## Architecture

### Components

The oracle service (`oracle-service/`) is a Node.js/Express HTTP API that:

1. **Accepts verification requests** — A client sends a payer's Stellar address, invoice amount, and invoice ID
2. **Queries historical invoice data** — Via the indexer service (`indexer/`), retrieves the payer's past invoice settlement record
3. **Fetches on-chain reputation** — Optionally calls a Soroban smart contract to read a reputation score stored on-chain
4. **Computes a trust score** — Analyzes payment history (success rate, default rate, amount patterns) and reputation to produce a fraud-detection assessment
5. **Returns a verification response** — Either "verified" (isVerified: true) or a detailed assessment with confidence levels and fraud signals

### Data Flow

### Key Types & Responses

**OracleVerificationRequest**
```typescript
{
  payer: string;                    // Stellar address
  amount: string | number | bigint; // Invoice amount
  invoiceId: string | number;       // Invoice identifier
  forceRefresh?: boolean;           // Bypass cache
  requestId?: string;               // Optional request correlator
  maxOracleAgeMs?: number;          // Max acceptable data age
}
```

**OracleVerificationResponse**
```typescript
{
  requestId: string;
  payer: string;
  invoiceId: string;
  amount: string;
  trustScore: number;               // 0–100
  confidence: number;               // 0.0–1.0 (data completeness confidence)
  confidenceLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  isVerified: boolean;              // true if trustScore >= 70 && confidence >= 0.55 && no fraud signals && fresh
  generatedAt: string;              // ISO 8601 timestamp
  dataAgeMs: number;                // Time since latest history/reputation source
  cacheHit: boolean;

  historicalSuccessRate: number;    // Past payment settlement rate
  historicalDefaultRate: number;    // Past defaults
  averageHistoricalAmount: string;
  amountDeviation: number;          // % deviation from historical average
  settlementVarianceDays: number;   // Settlement time variance
  fraudSignals: string[];           // Detected risk indicators
  evidence: string[];               // Human-readable assessment rationale
  composition: OracleSignalComposition; // Outcome policy, sub-scores, rationale
  attestation?: {                   // Present when ORACLE_SIGNING_KEY is set
    keyId: string;
    nonce: string;
    issuedAt: number;
    payload: string;                // This body as JSON, minus `attestation`
    signature: string;              // HMAC-SHA256
  };
}
```

## Trust & Fraud Detection Model

### Verification Criteria

A response is marked `isVerified: true` if **all** of the following hold:

- **trustScore ≥ 70** — Weighted combination of on-chain reputation (38%), success rate (33%), amount fit (17%), variance fit (12%), minus penalties for defaults and fraud signals
- **confidence ≥ 0.55** — At least moderate data completeness (weighted by history volume, reputation availability, and freshness)
- **No fraud signals** — Assessment detects no risk patterns
- **Fresh data** — dataAgeMs ≤ maxOracleAgeMs (default 5 minutes)

### Fraud Signal Detection

The service scans invoice history for:

1. **Multiple recent similar-amount invoices** — 3+ invoices within 30 days with ±5% of request amount
2. **Rapid succession** — 3+ invoices created within a 24-hour window
3. **Recent concentrated defaults** — 2+ defaults within the 30-day lookback
4. **Clustered ledger updates** — 4+ invoices with identical `updated_at` timestamps (possible ledger manipulation)

Each signal reduces trust score by ~9 points (up to 35-point maximum fraud penalty).

### Numeric Normalization & Edge Cases

**normalizeAmountToNumber()**
- Accepts: `string | number | bigint`
- Converts via `BigInt()` for precision, then to `Number`
- If BigInt conversion fails: falls back to `Number()` parsing
- If both fail: returns 0 or `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (conservative fallback)
- **Rationale for MAX_SAFE_INTEGER fallback**: Unparseable amounts may indicate tampering; treating them as "maximally large" is conservative for fraud detection

**normalizeTimestampToMs()**
- Accepts: `number | string | null | undefined`
- If null/undefined or ≤ 0: returns 0
- If < 1e12: treated as seconds, multiplied by 1000
- If ≥ 1e12: treated as milliseconds, returned as-is
- Handles both numeric and string inputs

## Resilience & Operational Characteristics

### Graceful Degradation on Indexer Downtime

If the indexer service (`indexer/` on port 3001) is unavailable or slow:

- The oracle continues to return a response (rather than failing the entire verification)
- History is treated as empty (`[]`), reverting to reputation-only assessment
- The `evidence` array includes: *"Indexer data unavailable; assessment based on on-chain reputation only"*
- `confidence` drops (no history volume to bolster confidence)
- `trustScore` still follows the weighted formula, but relies entirely on on-chain reputation (38% weight) plus default penalties

**Example**: an outage does not quietly become a clean bill of health. Reputation
carries 38% of the trust score, so reputation alone cannot clear the threshold of
70 — with a cold cache the payer is rejected as `rejected-low-trust` with the
unavailability recorded in `evidence`. With a warm cache the last clean verdict
keeps serving until it ages out, and then the same rejection applies.

That distinction is load-bearing: "this payer has no invoices" and "we could not
read the feed" are different facts, and the history provider re-throws transport
failures rather than collapsing them into `[]`. Transport-level proof lives in
`src/upstream-outage.test.ts`, exercised against a real socket.

**Implementation**: `Promise.allSettled()` ensures a failed indexer fetch doesn't block reputation retrieval or vice versa.

### Rate Limiting

To prevent denial-of-service attacks and probing of the fraud-detection heuristics:

- **Per-IP rate limiting**: 100 requests per minute (configurable via `ORACLE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`)
- **Sliding window**: 60-second window (configurable via `ORACLE_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`)
- **Response on limit exceeded**: HTTP 429 with `retryAfter` (seconds)
- **Can be disabled**: Set `ORACLE_ENABLE_RATE_LIMIT=false` in environment

### Caching

- **In-memory (default)** or **Redis-backed** (via `REDIS_URL`)
- **TTL**: 300 seconds (configurable)
- **Deduplication**: Concurrent identical requests within the same verification window share a single background fetch (via inflight map)
- **Force refresh**: `forceRefresh: true` in request bypasses cache

### Metrics

The oracle exposes Prometheus metrics on `/metrics`:

- `verification_total` — Count of verification requests
- `verification_duration_seconds` — Histogram of processing time
- `cache_hits_total` — Cache hits
- `cache_misses_total` — Cache misses
- `stale_responses_total` — Responses older than maxOracleAgeMs

## Integration with Trust & Liquidity Model

### Honest Scoping: What "Payer Verification" Actually Means (#867)

In public protocol narratives and SCF submissions, terms like "payer verification" or "credit assessment" can easily be misinterpreted as full legal Know-Your-Business (KYB) compliance. It is critical to state the exact operational scope honestly:

#### What `oracle-service` Currently Checks:
1. **On-chain Settlement Track Record:** Payment success rate and default rate computed from indexed historical events.
2. **Behavioral Inconsistencies:** Significant percentage deviations between the requested invoice amount and historical averages.
3. **Rapid Succession Abuse:** Burst creation of multiple invoices (3+ in 24 hours) from the same account.
4. **Default Clustering:** Recent concentration of defaults (2+ in 30 days) indicating immediate insolvency or malicious abandonment.
5. **Ledger Timing Anomalies:** Clustered `updated_at` timestamps (4+ in identical ledger windows) indicating potential transaction manipulation.
6. **Soroban Reputation Snapshot:** On-chain reputation scores emitted by protocol contracts.

#### What `oracle-service` Does NOT Check:
1. **Legal Business Existence:** Verification of official corporate registration, business licenses, or jurisdiction registry records (e.g. Delaware Division of Corporations, Companies House).
2. **Beneficial Ownership & Identity (KYC/KYB):** Identification or sanctions screening of company directors, Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs), or authorized signatories.
3. **Real-World Balance Sheet Solvency:** Off-chain bank account balances, audited financial statements, credit bureau scores (Dun & Bradstreet, Experian), or cash flows.
4. **Tax Compliance:** Valid VAT, EIN, or tax registration status.

---

### Pluggable External KYB Provider Architecture (#868)

To bridge the gap between purely behavioral on-chain heuristics and legal entity verification, `oracle-service` provides a pluggable adapter interface:

```typescript
export interface KYBVerificationResult {
  provider: string;
  isVerified: boolean;
  businessName?: string;
  registrationNumber?: string;
  jurisdiction?: string;
  riskScore?: number;
  verifiedAt?: string;
  signals?: string[];
  rawDetails?: Record<string, unknown>;
}

export interface VerificationProvider {
  name: string;
  verifyPayer(
    payerAddress: string,
    metadata?: Record<string, unknown>
  ): Promise<KYBVerificationResult>;
}
```

#### How It Works:
- `OracleVerifier` accepts an optional `kybProvider` implementing `VerificationProvider`.
- When assessing a verification request, `OracleVerifier` executes the external KYB check in parallel with indexer history and Soroban reputation RPC calls via `Promise.allSettled()`.
- If the external KYB provider returns `isVerified: false`, the oracle rejects verification (`isVerified: false`), adds a fraud signal (`External KYB provider verification failed or unverified`), and records the provider's diagnostic signals into the evidence log.
- A reference implementation is provided in `oracle-service/src/kyb/mockProvider.ts` (`MockKYBProvider`), allowing seamless local testing and straightforward production adapter implementations for external vendors (e.g., Middesk, Sumsub, Trulioo).

### Use in fund_invoice()

When a smart contract (or SDK) calls `fund_invoice()`:

1. SDK or contract calls `POST /v1/verify` with payer address, amount, invoice ID
2. Oracle returns `trustScore`, `confidence`, and `isVerified`
3. Contract or SDK uses `isVerified` as a gate (or treats the score as input to a more complex rule)
4. On-chain, the reputation contract may be updated post-settlement, feeding future assessments

### Feedback Loop

As invoices are settled (paid or defaulted) and indexed by `indexer/`, subsequent verification calls for the same payer will see updated history, potentially increasing or decreasing their trust score. This creates a continuous feedback loop without requiring manual intervention.

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Tests

- `verifier.test.ts`: Core trust-score computation, fraud signal detection, history/reputation fallback
- `index.test.ts`: HTTP API behavior, caching, rate limiting
- Property-based tests for numeric normalization edge cases

### Property-Based Test Coverage

- `normalizeAmountToNumber()`: valid strings, bigints, numbers; extreme values; malformed inputs; fallback behavior
- `normalizeTimestampToMs()`: second vs. millisecond detection; null handling; positive/negative values

### Operational Testing

- Load tests: Verify concurrency handling, cache hit rates, and rate limiting behavior
- Downtime simulation: `src/upstream-outage.test.ts` plus
  `.github/workflows/oracle-chaos.yml`, described below

### Upstream outage (chaos) testing

The resilience claims above are about transport failures, and a mocked provider
cannot prove them: returning `[]` from a stub says nothing about a socket that
refused, a 503 body, a half-open connection or a 200 full of HTML. So the suite
runs the oracle against a real `node:http` listener that is driven into each of
those states, with the request timeout cut to 250 ms so every case is bounded by
the oracle's own deadline rather than by whatever the upstream eventually does.

What it pins down:

- The healthy path really reaches the indexer over HTTP, at the path and with the
  query the indexer actually serves.
- An outage is reported as `external.status: 'unknown'` / an indexer-unavailable
  evidence line, never as a passing verdict.
- A last clean verdict keeps serving through the outage and stops once it ages
  out; a cold cache rejects instead of guessing.
- Recovery is immediate when the feed comes back, and a retry stampede against a
  dead upstream produces no unhandled rejections.
- An outage never resets the clock on data that was already stale.
- A dead Soroban RPC endpoint degrades reputation to zero without being
  misattributed to the indexer.
- The outage is observable: the outcome metric the rejection alert watches moves,
  and `/v1/health` still reports `ok` because a degraded upstream is a data
  problem, not a dead service.

CI runs the suite on every PR that touches `oracle-service/`, and nightly on the
default branch, posting the failure to the alert webhook with a link to the
runbook (`.github/workflows/oracle-chaos.yml`). A nightly run is the point: the
suite would otherwise only ever exercise failures the code handled the day
someone wrote the test.

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

1. **Reputation contract optional**: On-chain reputation is currently optional; if not configured, all payers get 0 reputation score
2. **Single RPC source**: Reputation fetches use a single RPC endpoint; future work could add fallback chains
3. **In-memory rate limiting**: Does not persist across process restarts; should be Redis-backed in multi-instance deployments
4. **No API key authentication**: Rate limiting is per-IP only; authenticated API keys could enable per-user limits
5. **Fraud signal heuristics are static**: Thresholds (3 similar invoices, 24-hour window, etc.) are hardcoded; future versions could make these configurable or learned
6. **A plain-HTTP Soroban endpoint fails silently**: stellar-sdk refuses insecure
   RPC URLs unless `allowHttp` is set, and `fetchOnChainReputation()` collapses
   every failure — including that one — into a zeroed snapshot. Pointing
   `ORACLE_REPUTATION_RPC_URL` at `http://localhost:8000` therefore looks like a
   payer with no reputation, not a misconfiguration. The chaos suite asserts the
   degraded behaviour and documents why it cannot assert *why* the endpoint
   refused; surfacing configuration failures distinctly is open work.
7. **Integrity checking is on-demand**: nothing walks the audit chain on a
   schedule, so `oracle_audit_integrity_failures_total` stays at zero until
   someone calls `GET /v1/audit/integrity`. Continuous detection needs a poller
   or a sweep inside the existing hourly retention job.
8. **No API authentication on the admin surface**: `/v1/audit/entries` returns
   payer addresses and invoice outcomes, and `/v1/signing/config` publishes
   rotation state. Both are read-only and carry no secrets, but they must not sit
   on the public listener — rate limiting per IP is not access control.
