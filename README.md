**Turn unpaid invoices into instant liquidity on-chain, on Stellar.**

Invoice Liquidity Network (ILN) is an open-source, decentralised invoice factoring protocol built on [Stellar](https://stellar.org) using [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org) smart contracts. Freelancers, creators, and SMEs unlock the value of outstanding invoices immediately, while DeFi liquidity providers earn yield by funding them at a discount.

No banks. No credit checks. No 60-day waits.

## How It Works

```
Freelancer                  ILN Contract              Liquidity Provider
    |                            |                            |
    |--- submit_invoice() ------>|                            |
    |    (amount, payer,         |                            |
    |     due_date, discount)    |                            |
    |                            |<--- fund_invoice() --------|
    |                            |    (sends USDC at          |
    |<-- receives USDC -------   |     discounted amount)     |
    |   (amount - discount)      |                            |
    |                            |                            |
   ...    invoice due date       ...                          |
    |                            |                            |
  Payer --- mark_paid() -------->|                            |
                                 |--- releases full amount -->|
                                      (LP earns the spread)
```

1. **Submit** — A freelancer calls `submit_invoice()` with amount, payer, due date, and discount rate
2. **Fund** — A liquidity provider calls `fund_invoice()`, sending USDC. The freelancer receives funds immediately
3. **Pay** — The payer settles the invoice, releasing the full amount to the LP
4. **Earn** — The LP earns the discount spread as yield

## What's in This Repo

This is the **organisation root** — it contains shared infrastructure used across all ILN sub-projects:

### SDK (`sdk/`)

A typed JavaScript/TypeScript SDK with browser Freighter signing and Node.js keypair support.

```bash
npm install @invoice-liquidity/sdk
```

See [`sdk/README.md`](./sdk/README.md) for full API documentation.

### CLI (`cli/`)

A command-line tool for interacting with the ILN contract on testnet and mainnet.

```bash
npm install -g @invoice-liquidity/cli
```

```bash
iln submit --payer G... --amount 100 --due 2025-12-31 --rate 300
iln fund --id 1
iln pay --id 1
iln status --id 1
```

See [`cli/README.md`](./cli/README.md) for setup and usage.

This is the canonical CLI. `packages/cli` (`@iln/cli`) is a separate,
experimental package with a smaller command set — see
[`docs/cli-vs-cli-next.md`](./docs/cli-vs-cli-next.md) for the full
comparison and which one to use.

**Development vs Production CLI:**
- The published CLI package (`@invoice-liquidity/cli`) installs the `iln` binary — this is the public-facing tool for interacting with the ILN contract.
- The monorepo's development tooling includes an internal `iln-dev` binary (via `pnpm iln-dev`) — this is an internal development/configuration tool with no public API. Do not install the root package globally; use the CLI package instead.

### Indexer service (`indexer/`)

The production event indexer service — deployed to Railway, polls the Soroban
RPC, persists to SQLite, and exposes a REST + GraphQL API for the frontend.

See [`docs/indexer/`](./docs/indexer/) for architecture, API reference, and deployment guide.

### Indexer client library (`packages/indexer/`)

`@iln/indexer` — a publishable Horizon-based event indexer utility for
frontend apps and external tooling. Wraps the Horizon REST API with typed
pagination and SSE streaming.

```bash
pnpm add @iln/indexer
```

See [`packages/indexer/README.md`](./packages/indexer/README.md) for API reference and usage.

> The two indexer packages are **not duplicates** — they use different data
> sources (Soroban RPC vs Horizon) and serve different purposes. The service
> (`indexer/`) is what the frontend queries; the library (`packages/indexer/`)
> is for direct Horizon-based integrations. See
> [`docs/indexer/README.md`](./docs/indexer/README.md) for a full comparison.

### Notifications (`notifications/`)

A webhook-based notification service for invoice lifecycle events.

See [`docs/notifications.md`](./docs/notifications.md) for setup.

### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Deployment and development helper scripts.

| Script                    | Purpose                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `scripts/deploy.ts`       | Deploy contract to testnet/mainnet |
| `scripts/fund-wallets.sh` | Fund testnet wallets via Friendbot |
| `scripts/seed.sh`         | Seed test data                     |
| `scripts/dev-setup.sh`    | Set up a local dev environment     |

## Workspace Layout

This is a **pnpm workspace** (see `pnpm-workspace.yaml`). For a complete table with status, purpose, and dependency information for every workspace, see [docs/monorepo-map.md](docs/monorepo-map.md).

The table below lists every workspace package, its directory, npm package name, and role. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is the single source of truth — the `workspaces` field has been removed from `package.json` because pnpm ignores it.

### Top-level service packages

| Directory | Package name | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `sdk/` | `@invoice-liquidity/sdk` | TypeScript SDK — browser Freighter + Node.js keypair signing |
| `cli/` | `@invoice-liquidity/cli` | Published CLI (`iln` binary) for interacting with the contract |
| `indexer/` | `iln-indexer` | Production event indexer service — Soroban RPC → SQLite → REST/GraphQL, deployed on Railway |
| `notifications/` | `@invoice-liquidity/notifications` | Webhook notification service for invoice lifecycle events |
| `docs/` | `@invoice-liquidity/docs` | Nextra 2 legacy docs source — content `.md` files; **not deployed** (migration in progress) |

### Shared library packages (`packages/*`)

| Directory | Package name | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/sdk/` | `@iln/sdk` | SDK package variant (experimental / next iteration) |
| `packages/cli/` | `@iln/cli` | CLI package variant (experimental) — see [`docs/cli-vs-cli-next.md`](./docs/cli-vs-cli-next.md) |
| `packages/docs/` | `@invoice-liquidity/docs-next` | **Canonical deployed docs site** (Nextra 3, Next.js 15 App Router) — [docs.iln.finance](https://docs.iln.finance) |
| `packages/shared/` | `@iln/shared` | Shared utilities consumed by SDK, CLI, and other packages |
| `packages/indexer/` | `@iln/indexer` | Horizon-based event indexer utility library (stateless, publishable) |
| `packages/invoice-sdk/` | `@iln/invoice-sdk` | Invoice SDK variant |
| `packages/react/` | `@iln/react` | React component library for ILN protocol interactions |
| `packages/opentelemetry/` | `@iln/opentelemetry` | OpenTelemetry instrumentation helpers |
| `packages/mock-backend/` | `@iln/mock-backend` | Mock backend for local testing without a live Stellar node |
| `packages/eslint-config/` | `@iln/eslint-config` | Shared ESLint configuration used across all workspaces |
| `packages/test-utils/` | `@iln/test-utils` | Test helper utilities shared across packages |
| `packages/upgrade-tests/` | `@iln/upgrade-tests` | Upgrade compatibility test suite |
| `packages/scripts/` | *(internal)* | Internal dev scripts and the `iln-dev` binary |

### Example applications (`examples/*`)

| Directory | Role |
|---|---|
| `examples/analytics-plugin/` | Analytics plugin integration example |
| `examples/governance-monitor/` | On-chain governance monitoring example |
| `examples/javascript-example/` | Plain JavaScript SDK usage example |
| `examples/lp-automation/` | Automated LP funding bot example |
| `examples/portfolio-report/` | LP/freelancer portfolio report script |
| `examples/react-example/` | React app SDK integration example |
| `examples/submit-invoice/` | Invoice submission walkthrough example |
| `examples/typescript-example/` | TypeScript SDK usage example |

> Directories without a `package.json` (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `tests/`, `workers/`, etc.) are **not** pnpm workspaces — they are submodules, supporting scripts, or non-JS artefacts.

## Security

Please refer to our [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md) for information on supported versions and how to report vulnerabilities privately.

## Documentation Site

The ILN documentation site is built with [Nextra 3](https://nextra.site) and deployed to
**[docs.iln.finance](https://docs.iln.finance)** from [`packages/docs/`](./packages/docs).

Two documentation directories exist during an in-progress migration:

- **`packages/docs/`** (`@invoice-liquidity/docs-next`) — the **canonical, deployed site** (Nextra 3, Next.js 15 App Router). This is what `docs-deploy.yml` builds and publishes to GitHub Pages.
- **`docs/`** (`@invoice-liquidity/docs`) — the **legacy source** (Nextra 2, Next.js 14 Pages Router). Not deployed. Holds the authoritative `.md` content files while migration is ongoing. The `docs-changelog.yml` workflow writes `docs/changelog.md` here.

See [`docs/DOCS_SETUP.md`](./docs/DOCS_SETUP.md) for the full migration checklist and remaining work.

### Local development

```bash
# Canonical site (Nextra 3 — what gets deployed)
pnpm --filter @invoice-liquidity/docs-next dev

# Legacy site (Nextra 2 — content source, not deployed)
pnpm --filter @invoice-liquidity/docs dev
```
