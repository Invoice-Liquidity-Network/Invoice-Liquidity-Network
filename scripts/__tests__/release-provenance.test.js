/**
 * Issue #878 — npm package provenance regression guard.
 *
 * Every release workflow that publishes to npm must actually be configured
 * for provenance attestation (the --provenance flag or NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE
 * plus the id-token: write permission GitHub Actions OIDC needs), and must
 * reference the real package name declared in the package directory it
 * publishes. The audit this test encodes found that the provenance flags
 * were correct but two workflows referenced stale state (an old package name
 * and a private package); both were fixed and this test keeps the
 * configuration honest.
