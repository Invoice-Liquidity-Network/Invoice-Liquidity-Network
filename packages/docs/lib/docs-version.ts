/**
 * Version metadata rendered by the docs version banner.
 *
 * The docs site is **single-track**: it always documents the latest development
 * version of the protocol, which is the build currently deployed to Stellar
 * testnet. There are no per-version doc snapshots, so readers need an explicit
 * statement of what the prose is written against — that is what these constants
 * (and the banner they feed) provide.
 *
 * Canonical source: `docs/version-manifest.json`. These constants mirror it so
 * the Next.js app never has to import a file from outside its own package root.
 * `scripts/check-compatibility.ts` fails CI if they drift from the manifest, or
 * if the declared contract/SDK pair is missing from the compatibility matrix in
 * `docs/cross-repo-dependencies.md`.
 *
 * Keep each `export const` on a single line with a plain string literal — the
 * compatibility checker parses this file textually.
